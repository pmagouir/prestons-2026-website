					<p>
						My professional path began with a personal realization: access to opportunity changes
						lives. My own trajectory shifted because a high school teacher saw potential in me,
						opening the door to college and a future I had not imagined.
					</p>

					<p>
						I dedicate my career to scaling that access to opportunity for others. This mission
						demands respect for and understanding of evidence, high-level strategic direction, and
						technical precision to execute. I pursued rigorous training in causal inference and
						data science to personally build the systems that measure and drive impact.
					</p>

					<p>
						I operate as both a strategist and a technician. I design organizational roadmaps and
						execute the technical infrastructure required to achieve them. Whether engineering
						predictive models, designing Salesforce environments, or restructuring large-dollar
						financial partnerships and program operations, I bridge the gap between abstract
						strategy and operational reality. I solve complex fragmentation problems by building
						cohesive, evidence-based systems, and the extraordinary teams required to maintain
						them.
					</p>

					<p>
						I live in Washington, D.C. I am fortunate to have married my best friend and favorite
						person, adopted the greatest rescue on the planet over 12 years ago, and spent the
						last two years with George, the coolest kid in The District who makes me the proudest
						dad alive.
