				I bring the same systems thinking to fitness that I bring to my teams at work: clear goals, measurable progress, and frameworks that adapt when life doesn't cooperate.
			</p>

			<p>
				I get it. You're balancing a career, a family, a social life, and somewhere in there you're supposed to train consistently and eat well. The fitness industry doesn't help. It's either overly intense, unnecessarily restrictive, or so vague you don't know where to start.
			</p>

			<p>
				Most people don't need a complicated program. They need a clear system, someone to help them adjust it until it works, and the accountability to keep it running.
			</p>

			<p>
				That's what I do.
			</p>

			<p>
				I navigate the same competing demands you do. I know what it takes to stay consistent when work gets heavy, when kids get sick, when travel throws off your routine. I've built systems that hold up under real life pressure, and I've helped other athletes do the same.
			</p>

			<p>
				I believe it's important to train a broad range of skills under varied loads and time domains. Speed and endurance are great, as is strength or power, but none alone is as great for health and longevity as each combined. To ensure I'm moving toward a better, more balanced version of my own fitness, I stay in touch via a regular battery of assessments. I built a tool to capture the assessments and results, framing a summary of strengths and opportunities. Take a look and look me up if you like what you see or notice you have room to grow!

				Here's how I work: I'll learn your background, what's worked before, and what hasn't. I'll share my philosophy on the non-negotiables and what can flex to fit you as an individual. Communication stays open. Discipline and accountability drive the bus.

				I've coached CrossFit since 2018 across group classes, personal training, and remote programming for athletes ranging from first-timers to competitive qualifiers. In 2024, I earned both the CF-L3 and Certified CrossFit Trainer (CCFT) credentials, a distinction held by roughly 1% of CrossFit coaches. As an athlete, I've also qualified for and competed in the CrossFit Games Quarterfinals multiple times, placing in the top 5-10% of Rx participants worldwide. While far from 'competitive' in the sport, I appreciate and enjoy the challenge to maintain and improve fitness as I age. As my son gets older, I know I'll need it.
